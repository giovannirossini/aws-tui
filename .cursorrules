# AWS Terminal UI (aws-tui) Project Rules

This project is an AWS Terminal UI (TUI) written in Go.

## General Principles
- You are a Senior Go Engineer.
- Write idiomatic Go code.
- Prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness.
- Maintain a consistent coding style.
- Use the latest stable versions of dependencies.

## Go Specifics
- Use `gofmt` or `goimports` for formatting.
- Handle errors explicitly. Avoid ignoring errors with `_`.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (CamelCase).
- Prefer using the AWS SDK for Go v2.
- For the TUI framework, prefer [Bubble Tea (charmbracelet/bubbletea)](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) unless otherwise specified.

## Project Structure
- Follow standard Go project layout (e.g., `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`).
- `cmd/aws-tui/main.go`: Entry point.
- `internal/`: Private application and library code.
- `pkg/`: Code that's okay for other projects to consume (use sparingly).

## AWS SDK Usage
- Use the AWS SDK for Go v2 (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2`).
- Ensure proper configuration handling (profiles, regions, credentials).
- Use lazy loading for AWS clients to improve startup time.

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Aim for a clean, responsive terminal interface.
- Provide clear feedback for long-running operations (e.g., loading spinners).
- Use consistent keyboard shortcuts.
- Support common terminal features like mouse support and window resizing.

## Dependencies
- Manage dependencies using Go modules (`go.mod`).
- Keep `vendor/` directory if preferred, but Go modules are standard.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for logic in `internal/` and `pkg/`.
- Use the standard `testing` package.
- Mock AWS services for testing.
